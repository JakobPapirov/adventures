# First official commit!

I belive that this next big project has finally taken a shape and form!

The progress has been long, first I figured I'd use Bootstrap for the design, then writing the whole thing from scratch, then using CSSgrids and now, hopefully, finally - Tailwindcss (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/)!

I've long wanted to make this site/project and even though I might not have that time this year, (I need to finish current projects and reach certain milestones) the shape of the project is set.

## Backend?

At this point, no backend is considered necessary, but I might want to eventually to access templateing feature and perhaps I might want to add a DB. If I do, then perhaps I'd go for Django for the built-in SQLite DB.
